<Heading>The remarkable thing about startup.</Heading>
<Paragraph> Throughout my early career as a developer and product manager, I constantly felt that owning new technology development was something that could only be accomplished by a few departments in a company. What excites me the most about the no-code movement - and what we’ve delivered so far as part of it - is the ability to empower passionate, and customer-centric people to create customer at the level it can and should be digital.</Paragraph> 
<Paragraph> ‍EverAfter is about enabling customer-facing teams to pave the customer journey the way they imagine it, without depending on external resources to make that experience happen. That journey begins from the customer’s first touch, and goes on to onboarding, to the ongoing relationship and successful retention.</Paragraph> \
